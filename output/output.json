Dunn, Clavicula Press, USA \u201cFor over 10 years we have used Antenna House Formatter to create PDFs of the majority of our product documentation. In the early days of using Formatter, I was really impressed by the reaction we got when we pointed out a shortcoming in the way Antenna House was formatting MathML equations. Instead of brushing off our concerns, Antenna House developers refactored their MathML process and when the solution was released, all our concerns were addressed. Another highlight is the Internationalization support that is integrated into Formatter. When we needed to produce PDF Hebrew translations of our xml documentation years ago, we assumed it would be a huge effort. It was very easy to use Formatter to produce the \u201cright to left\u201d Hebrew PDF and everyone was impressed with the quality.\u201d \u2013 Nick Green, Software Manager at SAS Institute Inc., USA \u201cWe use Formatter and the MathML option to publish PDF versions of our software manuals.

She flows quietly, but the banks are bustling with excitement. Here, water from the river is packed in customised bottles,  ready for devotees to take back to their hometowns. Priests perform pujas with reverential devotees, all set to take a holy dip, with cries of \u2018Ganga mata ki jai\u2019 frequently emerging from the many boats lined up here. The Sangam \u2014 or the Triveni Sangam \u2014 is the place to be at Prayagraj. It is the confluence of three rivers \u2014 the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati \u2014 and one has to travel quite a bit by boat from the banks to reach here. A dip here is said to cleanse one\u2019s soul and free them from rebirth. The Triveni Sangam is a major destination for Hindu pilgrimages and more so, during this time of the year. For, it is the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela, a time when people gather for what is described as the biggest religious congregation in the world. Boats arriving at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Srinivasa Ramanujam While the Kumbh Mela has often been associated with mammoth crowds and spiritual enlightenment, this year is all the more special, due to a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years. \u201cWhile the Ardh Kumbh Mela happens every six years, the Purna Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years. But this is the Maha Kumbh Mela and that happens only every 144 years,\u201d says Vikram Rana, a certified guide with UP Tourism who is currently based in Prayagraj. This once-in-144-years excitement is palpable on the streets of Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad. Sadhus arrive every day from various parts of India and set up makeshift tents on the banks; their home for a month or so. Some of them arrive in grand processions, while some others walk discreetly and settle down. And, for this grand event, braving the bitter Uttar Pradesh winter where temperatures can dip down to 7 degree celsius, devotees from across the world make a beeline to participate in the festivities and take a dip in the holy waters. A sadhu at the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement The sadhus of the Kumbh The major attraction during the Kumbh Mela is the Akharas (or Akhadas) \u2014 groups deeply rooted in the traditions of Hinduism. Akharas \u2014 said to be formed by Adi Shankaracharya to propagate spiritual learning and physical training \u2014 are currently 13 in number, falling under three sects or pants (the Shaivite, Vaishnavite and the udasin ). Sadhus (ascetics) from different centres belonging to these Akharas are currently camping at Prayagraj, for the Maha Kumbh Mela, which takes place till February 26. Some of them have travelled from places like Varanasi, Haridwar, Rishikesh and Ujjain, while a few have come all the way from the Himalayas, where they spend years in meditation and penance. The Naga sadhus are fascinating, with their unique appearances and rituals. We meet a sadhu who, for a decade now, has not sat down or attempted a typical sleeping position \u2014 he meditates with his arms resting on a mat. Another sadhu practises his yoga and penance with his hand tied up; his disciples say he has practised this form of hatha yoga for many years now. Another sadhu has had his left hand up in the air for many years now. Covered with ash and mostly naked, these sadhus evoke fear, admiration and respect from devotees, who seek their blessings, which also entail slapping the devotees hard on the back. \u201cThey (Naga sadhus ) are the ferocious ones. They have even helped fighting against invaders in the past,\u201d explains our guide, Vikram. Maha Kumbh 2025: Tips to know if you are planning to visit the mega event Pray, where are you? All these fascinating elements about the 2025 Maha Kumbh has led to an economic boost in Prayagraj, which is gearing up to provide for the surge in attendees. With about 40 crore people expected to experience the Mela, Prayagraj is among the most-discussed destinations this time of the year. Catering to this religious tourism are many travel players, who are putting together accommodation facilities for a peaceful experience of the Kumbh. Like j\u00fcSTa Shivir Jhusi, in which one can book luxury tents at about \u20b910,000 to \u20b935,000, which provides access to the Triveni Sangam via boat from its premises, thus by-passing maddening crowds. This 18-acre property, located on the banks of the Ganga, has 118 tents put together in the last few months specially for the Maha Kumbh 2025. They will be taken down after the festival. A view of the luxury tents at Justa Shivir Jhusi, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \u201cReligious tourism is an evolving market. It is moving to a needs-based market where patrons are looking for comfort. Here at the Kumbh Mela, we see two types of customer profile; a set that comes due to their religious inclination and another that comes to experience it as an event,\u201d describes Ashish Vohra, Founder-CEO, j\u00fcSTa Hotels and Resorts. With people coming from across the world, j\u00fcSTa Shivir has already about 70 percent occupancy level, which is scheduled to rise during important dates such as the Shahi Snan. \u201cWe are looking at a surge in demand from the South once the temperatures here become a little more amiable. Tamil Nadu is a big market for us, and at times, devotees\u00a0coming from South are even bigger in numbers than the North, as they combine the visit to the Kumbh Mela with other religious trips to Varanasi and Ayodhya . These events propel an economy and Prayagraj is at the centre of it right now,\u201d he adds. It certainly is, with more than 40 crore people likely in attendance (India\u2019s population is pegged at 140 crores now). \u201cNow it\u2019s more of a show than a kumbh ,\u201d says Mahamandeshwar Ji Maharaj of the Juna Akhada, one of the oldest and most respected Hindi monastic orders. His advice to devotees: \u201cCome without arrogance and ego because you are meeting God here.\u201d Devotees at the evening aarti at Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Srinivasa Ramanujam For that, Prayagraj seems ready. Over the next 45 days, people arriving in over 13,000 trains and 250 flights from across the country will experience the largest public gathering in the world. Servicing them will be hordes of police personnel, hospital staff and specially-built pontoon bridges across the Ganga. There\u2019s also a Kumbh AI centre, with art installations and creative illuminations.

She flows quietly, but the banks are bustling with excitement. Here, water from the river is packed in customised bottles,  ready for devotees to take back to their hometowns. Priests perform pujas with reverential devotees, all set to take a holy dip, with cries of \u2018Ganga mata ki jai\u2019 frequently emerging from the many boats lined up here. The Sangam \u2014 or the Triveni Sangam \u2014 is the place to be at Prayagraj. It is the confluence of three rivers \u2014 the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati \u2014 and one has to travel quite a bit by boat from the banks to reach here. A dip here is said to cleanse one\u2019s soul and free them from rebirth. The Triveni Sangam is a major destination for Hindu pilgrimages and more so, during this time of the year. For, it is the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela, a time when people gather for what is described as the biggest religious congregation in the world. Boats arriving at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Srinivasa Ramanujam While the Kumbh Mela has often been associated with mammoth crowds and spiritual enlightenment, this year is all the more special, due to a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years. \u201cWhile the Ardh Kumbh Mela happens every six years, the Purna Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years. But this is the Maha Kumbh Mela and that happens only every 144 years,\u201d says Vikram Rana, a certified guide with UP Tourism who is currently based in Prayagraj. This once-in-144-years excitement is palpable on the streets of Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad. Sadhus arrive every day from various parts of India and set up makeshift tents on the banks; their home for a month or so. Some of them arrive in grand processions, while some others walk discreetly and settle down. And, for this grand event, braving the bitter Uttar Pradesh winter where temperatures can dip down to 7 degree celsius, devotees from across the world make a beeline to participate in the festivities and take a dip in the holy waters. A sadhu at the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement The sadhus of the Kumbh The major attraction during the Kumbh Mela is the Akharas (or Akhadas) \u2014 groups deeply rooted in the traditions of Hinduism. Akharas \u2014 said to be formed by Adi Shankaracharya to propagate spiritual learning and physical training \u2014 are currently 13 in number, falling under three sects or pants (the Shaivite, Vaishnavite and the udasin ). Sadhus (ascetics) from different centres belonging to these Akharas are currently camping at Prayagraj, for the Maha Kumbh Mela, which takes place till February 26. Some of them have travelled from places like Varanasi, Haridwar, Rishikesh and Ujjain, while a few have come all the way from the Himalayas, where they spend years in meditation and penance. The Naga sadhus are fascinating, with their unique appearances and rituals. We meet a sadhu who, for a decade now, has not sat down or attempted a typical sleeping position \u2014 he meditates with his arms resting on a mat. Another sadhu practises his yoga and penance with his hand tied up; his disciples say he has practised this form of hatha yoga for many years now. Another sadhu has had his left hand up in the air for many years now. Covered with ash and mostly naked, these sadhus evoke fear, admiration and respect from devotees, who seek their blessings, which also entail slapping the devotees hard on the back. \u201cThey (Naga sadhus ) are the ferocious ones. They have even helped fighting against invaders in the past,\u201d explains our guide, Vikram. Maha Kumbh 2025: Tips to know if you are planning to visit the mega event Pray, where are you? All these fascinating elements about the 2025 Maha Kumbh has led to an economic boost in Prayagraj, which is gearing up to provide for the surge in attendees. With about 40 crore people expected to experience the Mela, Prayagraj is among the most-discussed destinations this time of the year. Catering to this religious tourism are many travel players, who are putting together accommodation facilities for a peaceful experience of the Kumbh. Like j\u00fcSTa Shivir Jhusi, in which one can book luxury tents at about \u20b910,000 to \u20b935,000, which provides access to the Triveni Sangam via boat from its premises, thus by-passing maddening crowds. This 18-acre property, located on the banks of the Ganga, has 118 tents put together in the last few months specially for the Maha Kumbh 2025. They will be taken down after the festival. A view of the luxury tents at Justa Shivir Jhusi, Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \u201cReligious tourism is an evolving market. It is moving to a needs-based market where patrons are looking for comfort. Here at the Kumbh Mela, we see two types of customer profile; a set that comes due to their religious inclination and another that comes to experience it as an event,\u201d describes Ashish Vohra, Founder-CEO, j\u00fcSTa Hotels and Resorts. With people coming from across the world, j\u00fcSTa Shivir has already about 70 percent occupancy level, which is scheduled to rise during important dates such as the Shahi Snan. \u201cWe are looking at a surge in demand from the South once the temperatures here become a little more amiable. Tamil Nadu is a big market for us, and at times, devotees\u00a0coming from South are even bigger in numbers than the North, as they combine the visit to the Kumbh Mela with other religious trips to Varanasi and Ayodhya . These events propel an economy and Prayagraj is at the centre of it right now,\u201d he adds. It certainly is, with more than 40 crore people likely in attendance (India\u2019s population is pegged at 140 crores now). \u201cNow it\u2019s more of a show than a kumbh ,\u201d says Mahamandeshwar Ji Maharaj of the Juna Akhada, one of the oldest and most respected Hindi monastic orders. His advice to devotees: \u201cCome without arrogance and ego because you are meeting God here.\u201d Devotees at the evening aarti at Prayagraj | Photo Credit: Srinivasa Ramanujam For that, Prayagraj seems ready. Over the next 45 days, people arriving in over 13,000 trains and 250 flights from across the country will experience the largest public gathering in the world. Servicing them will be hordes of police personnel, hospital staff and specially-built pontoon bridges across the Ganga. There\u2019s also a Kumbh AI centre, with art installations and creative illuminations. There\u2019s even computerised state-of-the-art lost and found centres in case someone loses their way in the milling crowds. The evenings are cold, chilly and unsparing, even for those with layers of clothing. And yet, there is a spring in everyone\u2019s step. For, it is the Maha Kumbh Mela.

The evenings are cold, chilly and unsparing, even for those with layers of clothing. And yet, there is a spring in everyone\u2019s step. For, it is the Maha Kumbh Mela.

Download Formatter What Our Customers Are Saying Previous \"The strength of Antenna House is not only its powerful and reliable tools, it\u2019s the whole team behind the software that makes it an overall wonderful experience to work together. Being responsible for our operations, I am glad to be able to rely on their fast and competent support.\" - Alexander Skrabal, Chief Operating Officer at Yonder AG, Switzerland \"The learning curve for transitioning from dsssl to xsl has not been as steep as I had imagined. I had been using the lettrine package in my dsssl-jadetex customization. I now have an xsl customization that calls the Formatter initial-letters extension, with all the functionality I had come to expect of lettrine. In particular, it can use a different (fancy) font for the drop cap than for the body-font, it can shape the margins to the contours of different drop cap letters, and it can present the remainder of the of the first word in small-caps, if desired. That's everything I want it to do.\" \u2013 Kevin M. Dunn, Clavicula Press, USA \u201cFor over 10 years we have used Antenna House Formatter to create PDFs of the majority of our product documentation. In the early days of using Formatter, I was really impressed by the reaction we got when we pointed out a shortcoming in the way Antenna House was formatting MathML equations. Instead of brushing off our concerns, Antenna House developers refactored their MathML process and when the solution was released, all our concerns were addressed. Another highlight is the Internationalization support that is integrated into Formatter. When we needed to produce PDF Hebrew translations of our xml documentation years ago, we assumed it would be a huge effort. It was very easy to use Formatter to produce the \u201cright to left\u201d Hebrew PDF and everyone was impressed with the quality.\u201d \u2013 Nick Green, Software Manager at SAS Institute Inc., USA \u201cWe use Formatter and the MathML option to publish PDF versions of our software manuals. We are extremely happy with the performance of Antenna House and the contact we have with the entire Antenna House team. General enquiries and support requests are always handled very quickly.\u201d \u2013 Ben Scotland, Speedgoat, Switzerland \u201cOSDC has been a key part of our knowledge repository architecture for many years and has converted over 100,000 documents. Thanks to OSDC, all documents in our knowledge repository have previews that make information visual and easy to scan. After identifying a document of interest, our people save time by viewing it right in the web browser via the converted PDF file \u2014 so there\u2019s no wait to download it, launch the appropriate application, and open the document.\u201d \u2013 Jase Wells, Director of Applications Development at Prophet, USA \u201cOffice Server Document Converter was instrumental to our effort [in migrating data] because it was relatively simple to use, it allowed for flexibility with error checking, naming, and export jobs. We couldn\u2019t have done this process [data migration] without the use of OSDC. Without it, when we went live on the new platform, our staff would have been required to log into the old system and look up data should that information not have been converted.\u201d \u2013 Pete Areddy, Chief Technical Officer at Zepf Center, USA Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 Resources CSS for Print This introduction guide is packed with examples for CSS Paged Media formatting based on Formatter.
